Hello and welcome to my code

I apologize that it is not using PHP and AJAX, i had the same problem I had with the midterm where phpMyAdmin did not want to log in anymore and take informaion from my code, which makes no sense but whatever, i didnt want to make a really cool TV show tracker anyways :(

So i decided to take a different approach to the project, taking into consideration the guidelines we were given:

Your web application should: 
Accept user input
Store data
Display data


So to tackle this, user input was easy, just give a yes or no option to the person on the website, giving the person a form of input of their opinion.bthen the html will save the click locally on the device which allowed me to avoid using PHPmyadmin (thank god). and since the data is stored locally on the user's computer I can easily recover the data of how many times the buttons were clicked.


Looking back after i already finished the project, im glad that everything to do with mysql and phpmyadmin decided to crash and burn because it helped motivate myself to actually go out and learn more in html. That push was kinda necessary for me because if not i probbably would have used the same code from the midterm with minor tweaks in names. I know this project isnt as advanced as i would have hoped it would be but its ok because i am still happy with how this came out. 

So to re answer the final question on the final- if i had infinite knowledge and time how would I improve my final project... I'd make phpMyAdmin a usable source for my work
